1. Third-Party Library: Matplotlib
- Justification for Use:
Matplotlib is a widely used and robust plotting library for Python that provides more than enough capabilities for creating animated 
visualizations. In this project, Matplotlib is used to create the real-time plots for device data(voltage/current) in the PyQT GUI.
It is very east to integrate with PyQt through the FigurCanvas and it amde an ideal choice to embed the grpahs into the user interface.
Matplotlib is a widely adopted, robust, and mature plotting library for Python that provides extensive capabilities for 

- Considerations:
Somethings to consider when choosing this library included:
    1. Performance: While suitable for most use cases, Matplotlib may not be optimal forr high-frequency real-time plotting or very large datasets. 
       In those cases, alternatives like PyQtGraph may be considered. However, for the use of this project, Matplotlib served its purpose and we did not 
       have to deal with extremely large datasets.
    2. Dependencies: Matplotlib adds to the overall package size and requires dependencies like NumPy.

2. Third-Party Library: PyQt5
- Justification for Use:
PyQt5 is the chosen GUI framework as per project requirements. It offers comprehensive widgets, signals/slots  for event handling, 
and seamless integration with Python.
